1.	Program type:
	Running the command `file ./level05` we see the file is 32-bit ELF
	executable.
	Running the command `checksec --file ./level05, we see that the stack is
	executable (NX disabled) and there is not stack canary (No canary found).

2.	Content:
	We have a call to fgets that fill a buffer of size 0x64 bytes with exactly
	0x64 bytes from stdin, and an initialization of a variable (var) to 0x0.

	A while loop iterates over the buffer and as long as var is less than the 
	length of the buffer's content, it lower case what can be lowercased.

	And then calls printf on the buffer directly and exit with 0x0.

3.	Solution:
	As the while loop lower case the content of the buffer, it prevents us from
	executing any shellcode that contains bytes which values range between 0x40
	and 0x5a. So to overcome this problem, we will put the shell in an 
	environment variable or as an argument for the binary, and fill the buffer
	with the right format string to change the exit address in GOT.
