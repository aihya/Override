1.	Content:
	The only user-defined function is 'main', inside of it there's scanf(3) 
	which reads a decimal number and put it in a variable.
	Then the value of the variable is compared with 0x149c (5276 in decimal)
	and a system("/bin/sh") is called to spawn a shell if they are equal.

2.	Solution:
	Nothing fancy, we only need to pass the same value to make the statement 
	inside the if condition to be true.
